Task:
Create a web page with JavaScript to track and display an itemized shopping list and total.
What Will the Application Do?
● Display a list of products and prices with Add buttons
● When the user clicks a Check Out button, display all the items purchased and their
prices along with a grand total.
Build Specifications
1. You need to have a list of items on the page to select from. When you click on the
“add item” button, this item should be added to your shopping list.
2. Create an array for the items and an array for the corresponding prices
3. Loop through the arrays, printing out the name and price of each item on a new
line.
4. Total up the combined cost of all of your items with the amount’s label being “total.”
Hints
●
●
●
In JavaScript, arrays are enclosed in square brackets. [ ]
Remember to keep track of the total of all the prices and print this separately.
To keep it simple at first, you can display your output in an alert box. When that’s
working, display it in a separate part of this page.
Extended Challenges
● Use CSS to dress up the page
● Include quantities of items--either have a field next to the item for quantity to add,
or have every button click add another one of that item, or have + and - buttons (but
don’t let the user have a negative number of items!)
● Calculate and display sales tax (Michigan 6%) and grand total. Round all numbers to 2 digits. -->
